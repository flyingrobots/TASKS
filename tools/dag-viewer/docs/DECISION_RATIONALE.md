# DAG Viewer - Decision Rationale

## Key Design Decisions and Alternatives Considered

### 1. Technology Platform

#### Decision: Node.js
**Rationale**: Native JavaScript environment aligns with dagre library, excellent JSON handling, and widespread LLM tool ecosystem compatibility.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Python with NetworkX/Graphviz**
  - Pros: Rich data science ecosystem, matplotlib integration
  - Cons: Requires Python runtime, complex deployment, harder dagre integration
  - Rejected because: dagre is JavaScript-native, would require bridge or port

- **Go with graphviz bindings**
  - Pros: Single binary distribution, fast execution
  - Cons: Limited graph layout libraries, complex HTML generation
  - Rejected because: Lacks mature DAG-specific layout algorithms

- **Rust with petgraph**
  - Pros: Performance, memory safety
  - Cons: Steep learning curve, limited visualization libraries
  - Rejected because: Overkill for this use case, complex HTML templating

### 2. Output Format

#### Decision: Standalone HTML with embedded dependencies
**Rationale**: Zero-dependency viewing, works offline, easily shareable, no server required.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **React/Vue Single Page Application**
  - Pros: Rich interactivity, component reusability
  - Cons: Requires build step, larger file size, needs server
  - Rejected because: Adds complexity for LLM invocation

- **SVG file only**
  - Pros: Simple, vector graphics, small size
  - Cons: No interactivity, limited styling options
  - Rejected because: Lacks interactive features needed for exploration

- **PDF export**
  - Pros: Universal viewing, print-ready
  - Cons: No interactivity, requires additional libraries
  - Rejected because: Static format doesn't support graph exploration

- **JSON + separate viewer application**
  - Pros: Separation of concerns, multiple viewer options
  - Cons: Requires additional tool installation
  - Rejected because: Not self-contained for LLM use

### 3. Graph Layout Library

#### Decision: dagre with dagre-d3
**Rationale**: Purpose-built for DAG layout, automatic positioning, integrates with D3.js for rendering.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Cytoscape.js**
  - Pros: More layout algorithms, built-in interactivity
  - Cons: Larger library size, overkill for DAGs
  - Rejected because: dagre is more specialized for our use case

- **vis.js Network**
  - Pros: Easy to use, good defaults
  - Cons: Less control over layout, physics simulation not needed
  - Rejected because: Physics-based layout inappropriate for DAGs

- **D3.js force layout**
  - Pros: Highly customizable, well-documented
  - Cons: Not optimized for DAGs, requires manual positioning logic
  - Rejected because: Force-directed layout doesn't respect hierarchy

- **Custom layout algorithm**
  - Pros: Full control, optimized for T.A.S.K.S
  - Cons: Complex implementation, reinventing the wheel
  - Rejected because: dagre already solves this problem well

### 4. CLI Framework

#### Decision: Commander.js
**Rationale**: Declarative API, automatic help generation, industry standard for Node.js CLIs.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **yargs**
  - Pros: More features, command grouping
  - Cons: Larger dependency, complex API
  - Rejected because: Overkill for our simple needs

- **minimist**
  - Pros: Minimal, no dependencies
  - Cons: Manual validation, no help generation
  - Rejected because: Requires more boilerplate code

- **Native Node.js process.argv**
  - Pros: No dependencies
  - Cons: Manual parsing, error-prone
  - Rejected because: Too low-level, prone to bugs

### 5. Error Handling Strategy

#### Decision: Structured JSON responses with error codes
**Rationale**: Machine-readable for LLMs, consistent format, actionable error information.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Throw exceptions**
  - Pros: Standard Node.js pattern
  - Cons: Not LLM-friendly, stack traces are noisy
  - Rejected because: LLMs need structured output

- **Plain text error messages**
  - Pros: Human-readable
  - Cons: Hard to parse programmatically
  - Rejected because: LLMs benefit from structured data

- **Exit codes only**
  - Pros: Unix philosophy
  - Cons: Limited error information
  - Rejected because: Insufficient detail for debugging

### 6. Data Validation Approach

#### Decision: Schema validation at runtime
**Rationale**: Catches errors early, provides clear feedback, ensures data integrity.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **TypeScript interfaces only**
  - Pros: Compile-time checking
  - Cons: No runtime validation
  - Rejected because: Can't validate external JSON input

- **JSON Schema with ajv**
  - Pros: Standard schema format, powerful validation
  - Cons: Additional dependency, complex schemas
  - Rejected because: Overkill for our simple schemas

- **No validation (trust input)**
  - Pros: Simple, fast
  - Cons: Fragile, poor error messages
  - Rejected because: LLM-generated data needs validation

### 7. Visualization Rendering

#### Decision: SVG with D3.js
**Rationale**: Scalable graphics, DOM manipulation, rich styling options, industry standard.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Canvas rendering**
  - Pros: Better performance for large graphs
  - Cons: No DOM access, harder interactivity
  - Rejected because: SVG sufficient for our scale

- **WebGL with Three.js**
  - Pros: 3D visualization, GPU acceleration
  - Cons: Complex, overkill for 2D DAGs
  - Rejected because: Unnecessary complexity

- **HTML/CSS only**
  - Pros: Simple, no libraries needed
  - Cons: Hard to position nodes, limited graphics
  - Rejected because: Insufficient for complex layouts

### 8. Dependency Management

#### Decision: Minimal dependencies, CDN for client libraries
**Rationale**: Reduces installation size, leverages browser caching, simplifies deployment.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Bundle all dependencies**
  - Pros: Truly offline, version control
  - Cons: Large HTML files, no caching benefit
  - Rejected because: Unnecessary file size increase

- **npm for everything**
  - Pros: Consistent management, lock files
  - Cons: Requires build step for client code
  - Rejected because: Adds complexity for HTML generation

- **Webpack/Rollup bundling**
  - Pros: Optimization, tree shaking
  - Cons: Build complexity, configuration overhead
  - Rejected because: Overkill for our simple needs

### 9. Configuration Approach

#### Decision: CLI arguments only, no config files
**Rationale**: Simpler for LLM invocation, stateless operation, no hidden configuration.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **.dagviewerrc config file**
  - Pros: Persistent settings, complex configuration
  - Cons: Hidden state, complexity
  - Rejected because: Stateless operation preferred

- **Environment variables**
  - Pros: Standard practice, secure for credentials
  - Cons: Hidden configuration, platform differences
  - Rejected because: Not needed for our use case

- **Interactive prompts**
  - Pros: User-friendly, guided setup
  - Cons: Not LLM-compatible
  - Rejected because: Breaks automation

### 10. Testing Strategy

#### Decision: Jest for unit tests, example files for integration
**Rationale**: Popular framework, good assertion library, snapshot testing for HTML.

**Alternatives Considered**:
- **Mocha + Chai**
  - Pros: Flexible, modular
  - Cons: More setup, multiple dependencies
  - Rejected because: Jest is more integrated

- **Node.js built-in test runner**
  - Pros: No dependencies
  - Cons: Limited features, newer API
  - Rejected because: Lacks maturity and features

- **No automated tests**
  - Pros: Faster initial development
  - Cons: Fragile, hard to maintain
  - Rejected because: Quality and reliability important

## Summary

These decisions prioritize:
1. **Simplicity**: Minimal dependencies and configuration
2. **LLM Compatibility**: Structured I/O, stateless operation
3. **Self-Contained Output**: No runtime dependencies for viewing
4. **Developer Experience**: Clear errors, standard tools
5. **Maintainability**: Modular architecture, well-tested code

The chosen stack (Node.js + dagre + D3.js) provides the best balance of capabilities, ecosystem support, and implementation simplicity for our specific use case of visualizing T.A.S.K.S DAGs for LLM consumption.
