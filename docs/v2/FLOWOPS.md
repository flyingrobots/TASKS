Hell yes, this is exactly what we invented it for. Seeing the DAG light up while 7 agents chew through a repo is chef’s kiss.

  

Here’s my blunt take, then the upgrade path:

  

# **Verdict**

- **T.A.S.K.S. (planning)**: **A / 10⁄10.** You produced a real plan, not vibes. One bad edge on P1.T026—fine.
    
- **WaveOps (execution strategy)**: **C+ / 6.5⁄10.** It shipped, but you left parallelism and adaptability on the table.
    

  

# **What you nailed**

1. **Explicit dependencies → zero “mystery order.”**
    
2. **Visual feedback loop** that kept momentum high (real effect).
    
3. **Repo-native provenance** (Plan.md + dag.json) so the history tells the story.
    

  

# **Where it dragged**

1. **Hard wave barriers** created idle time (your P1.T011 example).
    
2. **No circuit breakers**—Wave 13 should’ve tripped an “install-all-UI-deps” batch after the 2nd identical failure.
    
3. **Edge hygiene**—cleanup/config tasks should rarely be roots (P1.T026).
    

---

# **Do this next: WaveOps →** 

# **FlowOps**

  

Keep T.A.S.K.S. as-is. Replace WaveOps with a **rolling frontier executor** that adapts mid-run.

  

## **1) Rolling Frontier (core loop)**

- Tasks run **as soon as deps are satisfied**—no wave barriers.
    
- Priority favors:
    
    - shallower depth (unblocks more),
        
    - higher **parallel_opportunity**,
        
    - higher **confidence**,
        
    - lower **rollback_cost**.
        
    

```
frontier = all(tasks where deps_satisfied)
while frontier.nonEmpty():
  batch = frontier.pop_all_ready_sorted(by: priority(depth, parallel_opportunity, -rollback_cost, confidence))
  run_in_parallel(batch, onError=handle_error)
  mark_done(batch)
  frontier += newly_unblocked_tasks()
```

## **2) Circuit Breakers (automatic “don’t be dumb”)**

  

Trigger a re-plan instead of grinding.

- **RepeatedSimilarErrors(threshold=2, window=10min)** → run a **pattern playbook**.
    
- **TimeOverrun(x2 estimate)** → raise priority of “diagnostic” tasks (smoke tests, graph scans).
    
- **Flapping task** (fails→passes→fails) → quarantine and gate its dependents.
    

  

Example config baked into your plan:

```
{
  "circuit_breakers": [
    {
      "name": "ui-missing-deps",
      "match": { "message_regex": "(Can't resolve|module not found).*(radix|lucide|class-variance)" },
      "action": "batch_install_by_import_scan",
      "scope": "apps/*"
    }
  ]
}
```

## **3) Preflight passes (cheap wins)**

  

Run these _before_ execution:

- **Import census** per app/package → derive dependency set; compare to package.json → create/patch **InstallMissingDeps** tasks automatically.
    
- **Edge sanity**: flag “cleanup/update/fix” tasks that appear as roots; suggest edges from structural tasks.
    
- **Dry-run build** in a sandbox to discover missing deps fast.
    

  

## **4) Late-Bound Edges (edge inference)**

  

If a task touches files that are **produced** by another task, add a soft edge at runtime.

- Example: “Update gitignore” gains an edge on “Move apps” if the moved paths are referenced.
    

  

## **5) Rollback that isn’t theater**

  

Each task gets:

- rollback_cmd, **idempotency flag**, and **checkpoint label**.
    
- FlowOps can auto-generate a **reverse frontier** (topo-sorted back) to unwind safely.
    

  

Task shape (T.A.S.K.S. v2):

```
{
  "id": "P1.T011",
  "title": "Deduplicate services",
  "deps": ["P1.T009","P1.T010"],
  "estimate_minutes": 18,
  "confidence": "high",
  "rollback_cost": "medium",
  "cmd": "node scripts/dedupe-services.js",
  "rollback_cmd": "git restore -SW -- :packages/shared/services",
  "artifacts": ["packages/shared/services/**"],
  "labels": ["refactor","shared"],
  "smoke": "npm -w apps/web run build"
}
```

## **6) Pattern Playbooks (Wave 13 fix in one shot)**

  

When FlowOps detects “multiple missing UI deps,” it should:

1. **Scan imports**: grep -R "from '...'" apps/{web,admin} | parse
    
2. **Diff with package.json** across workspaces
    
3. **Batch install once** (not whack-a-mole):
    
    - npm -w apps/web i radix-ui/react-avatar lucide-react class-variance-authority ...
        
    
4. **Restart dev servers** and **rerun smoke** tasks.
    

  

Declare that playbook once:

```
{
  "playbooks": {
    "batch_install_by_import_scan": {
      "steps": [
        "node tools/scan-imports.js --workspaces apps/* > /tmp/imports.json",
        "node tools/missing-deps.js /tmp/imports.json > /tmp/missing.txt",
        "xargs -a /tmp/missing.txt npm -w ${workspace} install",
        "npm run restart:dev --workspaces"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## **7) Resource-aware parallelism**

  

Don’t nuke your laptop. FlowOps should:

- Cap concurrency by **CPU**, **IO**, and **workspace** (e.g., only 1 build per app at a time).
    
- Promote tasks that **unblock many** but are **cheap**.
    

  

## **8) Sentinels and Canaries**

- **Sentinel tasks** at the end of each depth level: lint, typecheck (JS: eslint only), build.
    
- **Canary smoke** after major graph cuts (e.g., after moving packages): run a micro-e2e (open page, render UI, call one API).
    

  

## **9) Provenance > pretty logs**

- Commit per task (conventional), tag per _frontier depth_, and write a tiny **provenance ledger**:
    
    - provenance/2025-08-19T00-02Z.jsonl with {task_id, started, finished, exit_code, artifacts_changed}

# **Minimal deliverables to lock in FlowOps**

  

Add these small files to your repo and you’re upgraded:

1. plans/<project>/tasks.v2.json (schema above)
    
2. plans/<project>/flowops.config.json
    
3. tools/scan-imports.js + tools/missing-deps.js (100 LOC total)
    
4. bin/flowops.js (the rolling-frontier loop; spawn + circuit-breakers)
    
5. provenance/ (auto-written)
    

  

If you want, I’ll sketch bin/flowops.js next with the real queue & worker code—JS only, no TypeScript, no frameworks, just Node, child_process, and a tiny priority queue.


You’re spot on: resources aren’t “part of the work,” but they **gate** the work. Treat them as first-class **constraints**, not DAG nodes.

  

Here’s the clean way to bolt that in without turning your graph into spaghetti:

  

# **Principles**

- **DAG = precedence only.** Keep it pure: “what must happen before what.”
    
- **Resources = constraints.** Represent capacity, exclusivity, and timing outside the DAG.
    
- **Scheduler = arbiter.** It launches only tasks that are both **topologically ready** _and_ **resource-feasible**.
    

  

# **Model it (minimal, powerful)**

  

## **1) Resource catalog**

```
{
  "resources": {
    "db.local":   { "capacity": 1, "mode": "exclusive", "class": "db", "lock_order": 10 },
    "db.prod":    { "capacity": 1, "mode": "exclusive", "class": "db", "window": "maintenance" },
    "fs.repo":    { "capacity": 1, "mode": "exclusive", "class": "fs", "lock_order": 20 },
    "cpu":        { "capacity": 8, "mode": "semaphore", "class": "compute" },
    "net.bandwidth": { "capacity": 2, "mode": "semaphore", "class": "network" }
  },
  "profiles": {
    "local": { "db.local": 1, "cpu": 6 },
    "ci":    { "db.local": 0, "cpu": 4 },
    "prod":  { "db.prod": 1, "cpu": 8 }
  }
}
```

## **2) Task asks**

```
{
  "id": "P1.T013",
  "title": "Apply migration 013",
  "deps": ["P1.T011","P1.T012"],
  "resources": [
    { "name": "db.local", "units": 1, "access": "write" },
    { "name": "cpu", "units": 2 }
  ],
  "risk": { "level": "high", "locks": ["db.local"] },
  "estimate_minutes": 3
}
```

- **access**: read = shared, write = exclusive (classic readers–writer).
    
- **units**: for semaphores (CPU, bandwidth).
    
- **locks**: duplicates the intent for the “danger” policy layer (freezes neighbors, approvals, etc.).
    

  

# **How it changes planning & execution**

  

## **Planning time (simulation, not reality)**

  

Run a quick **resource-aware list scheduler** to predict contention:

- Inputs: DAG + estimates + resource catalog/profile.
    
- Output:
    
    - **critical path** (time-wise, with resources),
        
    - **contention cohorts** (e.g., all DB-writers),
        
    - an **upper bound** on safe parallelism.
        
    

  

Use that to:

- Flag over-ambitious waves,
    
- Suggest **staggering** DB tasks,
    
- Surface **bottleneck resources** (“db.local capacity=1 will cap you at 1 task no matter how many agents you spawn”).
    

  

> TL;DR: plan stays a DAG, but you annotate it with “this is where you’ll queue.”

  

## **Execution time (real enforcement)**

  

Ready set = tasks with deps satisfied.

Launch rule = **ready ∩ resource-feasible**.

- Acquire locks in **global order** (lock_order) to avoid deadlocks.
    
- Use **read/write semantics** to allow concurrent reads, block on writes.
    
- Apply **profiles**: local dev vs CI vs prod change capacities without editing the plan.
    
- If a ready task can’t get resources, it waits; the scheduler starts another ready task that can.
    

  

# **Extra sauce (because you’re thorough)**

- **Anti-affinity / affinity**
    
    - antiAffinity: ["fs.repo"] → don’t run two file-smashers at once.
        
    - affinity: ["cache.warm"] → prefer co-location with a cache-warming task.
        
    
- **Calendars / windows**
    
    - Resources can have **maintenance windows**; scheduler simply won’t grant them outside the window (prod DB).
        
    
- **Modes**
    
    - preview mode: simulate timeline; print a **Gantt-ish** schedule to show where you’ll block on db.local.
        
    - what-if: change profile (e.g., spin up a second local DB container) and compare makespan.
        
    

  

# **Deadlock & starvation guards**

- **Global lock ordering** (you already modeled lock_order).
    
- **Try-lock with backoff**: If a task can’t acquire full set, release and requeue (prevents partial hold).
    
- **Aging priority**: tasks waiting a long time move up in the queue (no starvation).
    

  

# **Quick heuristics that pay for themselves**

- **Batching detector**: N tasks each need db.local for ≤1 min? Auto-suggest a single “batch migration” task.
    
- **Fusion**: Two adjacent write tasks to same resource with tiny gaps? Propose fusing into one composite to reduce lock churn.
    
- **Parallelization hints**: If db.local is your bottleneck, planner suggests “spin up db.local.1..N via docker-compose” and auto-rewrite tasks to target db.local.{i} with sharding if safe.
    

  

# **Minimal implementation checklist**

1. resources.json + profiles (local/ci/prod).
    
2. Extend task schema with resources[] {name, units, access}.
    
3. Add a **contention-aware ready queue**:
    
    - (topo_ready) → filter(resource_feasible) → priority(depth ↓, unblock_potential ↑, wait_time ↑).
        
    
4. Lock manager with global ordering + readers–writer semantics.
    
5. --preview simulator (prints a timeline + the capped concurrency).
    

  

# **Why this split works**

- You **keep the graph clean** (only precedence).
    
- You **predict concurrency** during planning (so you don’t promise 7 parallel agents when the DB is a single-lane bridge).
    
- You **enforce reality** during execution with locks/semaphores/calendars.
    

  

Short version: resources don’t belong _in_ the DAG, but they absolutely belong **next to it**, shaping both the plan’s expectations and the executor’s behavior.
