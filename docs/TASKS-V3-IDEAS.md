# T.A.S.K.S: Tasks Are Sequenced Key Steps – LLM Execution Spec (v2.1)

*An enhanced planning system that transforms technical documentation into validated, executable project plans with clear boundaries, existing codebase awareness, and decision rationale.*

## Mission

Transform raw technical plans into executable project roadmaps by:

1. **Researching existing codebase** for reusable components and extension points
2. **Extracting features** and breaking them into bounded, measurable tasks
3. **Inferring structural dependencies** to build an optimized execution graph
4. **Generating execution waves** with quality gates and sync points
5. **Documenting design decisions** with alternatives considered
6. **Producing artifacts** as structured JSON/Markdown for automated execution

## Core Principles

### Task Boundaries & Execution Guidance

Every task must define:

- **Expected Complexity**: Quantifiable estimate (e.g., "~35 LoC", "3-5 functions", "2 API endpoints")
- **Definition of Done**: Clear stopping criteria to prevent scope creep
- **Scope Boundaries**: Explicit restrictions on what code/systems to modify
- **Logging Instructions**: Detailed guidance for execution agents on progress tracking

### Codebase-First Planning

Before task generation:

- **Inventory existing APIs**, interfaces, and components using ast-grep
- **Identify extension points** rather than creating duplicates
- **Document reuse opportunities** in Plan.md
- **Justify new implementations** in Decisions.md when not extending existing code

### Evidence-Based Dependencies

All tasks and dependencies must:

- **Cite source evidence** from the planning document
- **Classify dependencies** as technical, sequential, infrastructure, or knowledge
- **Assign confidence scores** [0..1] with rationale
- **Exclude resource constraints** (no "person X needs to be available" edges)

## Input Requirements

- **PLAN_DOC**: Raw technical specification (text/markdown)
- **Optional Parameters**:
  - `MIN_CONFIDENCE`: Minimum confidence for DAG inclusion (default: 0.7)
  - `MAX_WAVE_SIZE`: Maximum tasks per execution wave (default: 30)
  - `CODEBASE_PATH`: Repository root for analysis (default: current directory)

## Required Output Artifacts

All outputs must use exact file fence format:

1. `---file:features.json` - High-level capabilities
2. `---file:tasks.json` - Detailed task definitions with boundaries
3. `---file:dag.json` - Dependency graph and metrics
4. `---file:waves.json` - Execution waves with barriers
5. `---file:Plan.md` - Human-readable execution plan with codebase research
6. `---file:Decisions.md` - Design choices with alternatives and rationale

## Planning Process

Phase 1: Codebase & Resource Analysis (ENHANCED)
The planner must identify:

**1. Shared Implementation Resources:**

```javascript
// Use ast-grep patterns to find:
// - Database migration files
ast-grep --pattern 'class $_ < ActiveRecord::Migration'

// - Deployment configurations
ast-grep --pattern 'deploy:' --lang yaml

// - Shared test fixtures
ast-grep --pattern 'fixtures :$_'

// - Configuration modifications
ast-grep --pattern 'ENV[$_]'
```

**2. Document in tasks.json.meta.codebase_analysis.shared_resources:**

- Resource name and type
- Location in codebase
- Constraint type (exclusive, limited capacity)
- Reason for constraint

**3. For each task, identify:**

- Which exclusive resources it requires
- Which limited resources it needs (and how many)
- What shared state it creates or modifies

### Phase 2: Feature Extraction

Extract 5-25 features from PLAN_DOC:

- User-visible capabilities
- Infrastructure components
- Each with title, description, priority, and evidence

### Phase 3: Task Breakdown with Boundaries

For each feature, create tasks with:

- **Expected complexity** in measurable units (LoC, functions, endpoints)
- **Clear completion criteria** preventing scope creep
- **Explicit scope boundaries** defining included/excluded paths
- **Execution logging instructions** for progress tracking
- **Reuse mapping** to existing codebase components

Target granularity: 2-8 hours typical, 16 hours maximum

### Phase 4: Dependency Discovery

Classify dependencies as:

- `Technical`: Interface/artifact requirements (A produces what B consumes)
- `Sequential`: Information flow or logical ordering
- `Infrastructure`: Environment/tooling prerequisites
- `Knowledge`: Research/learning prerequisites
- `Mutual_Exclusion`: Shared resource requiring exclusive access
- `Resource_Limited`: Shared resource with limited capacity

#### Shared Resource Types

**Exclusive Resources (capacity = 1)**

- Database migration tools
- Schema modification locks
- Deployment pipelines
- Production database connections
- Certificate management systems

**Limited Capacity Resources (capacity > 1 but finite)**

- Test database pool (e.g., 3 instances)
- CI/CD runners (e.g., 5 parallel jobs)
- Staging environment slots
- API rate limits for third-party services

**Modifiable Shared State**

- Configuration files
- Environment variables
- Shared test fixtures
- Docker compose files

Assign confidence scores and mark as hard (blocking) or soft (advisory)

#### Phase 4.5: Resource Conflict Resolution (NEW)

After dependency discovery, before DAG construction:

**1. Identify Resource Conflicts:**

- Find all tasks requiring the same exclusive resource
- Find tasks competing for limited capacity resources
- Detect shared state modification conflicts

**2. Create Mutual Exclusion Edges:**

- For exclusive resources: Create mutual_exclusion dependencies between all tasks using that resource
- Use suggested ordering based on logical dependencies
- Set confidence = 1.0 for infrastructure-enforced exclusions

**3. Document Resolution Strategy:**

- **Sequential ordering**: Tasks must run one after another
- **Wave separation**: Tasks must be in different waves
- **Capacity planning**: Ensure wave doesn't exceed resource capacity

### Phase 5: DAG Construction

Build directed acyclic graph:

- Filter edges by MIN_CONFIDENCE and isHard flag
- Apply transitive reduction
- Detect and resolve cycles (max 2 attempts)
- Calculate metrics (density, width, critical path)

### Phase 6: Wave Generation

Create execution waves using Kahn's algorithm:

- Respect MAX_WAVE_SIZE constraint
- Maintain interface cohesion
- Balance load across waves
- Define sync barriers between waves

**Wave generation must respect resource constraints:**

```python
def generate_waves_with_resources(dag, max_wave_size, resource_capacity):
  waves = []
  while has_unassigned_tasks():
      candidate_wave = get_zero_indegree_tasks()
      
      # Apply resource constraints
      final_wave = []
      resource_usage = {}
      
      for task in candidate_wave:
          can_add = True
          
          # Check exclusive resources
          for resource in task.exclusive_resources:
              if resource in resource_usage:
                  can_add = False  # Resource already claimed
                  defer_task(task)  # Move to next wave
                  break
          
          # Check limited capacity resources  
          for resource in task.limited_resources:
              current_usage = resource_usage.get(resource, 0)
              if current_usage >= resource_capacity[resource]:
                  can_add = False
                  defer_task(task)
                  break
          
          if can_add and len(final_wave) < max_wave_size:
              final_wave.append(task)
              # Mark resource usage
              for resource in task.exclusive_resources:
                  resource_usage[resource] = 1
              for resource in task.limited_resources:
                  resource_usage[resource] = resource_usage.get(resource, 0) + 1
      
      waves.append(final_wave)
  
  return waves
```

### Phase 7: Documentation Generation

Produce comprehensive documentation:

- **Plan.md**: Execution roadmap with codebase research results
- **Decisions.md**: Design choices with alternatives considered

## Plan.md Enhanced Structure

```

## Decisions.md Structure

```markdown
# Design Decisions Log

## Decision 1: OAuth2 Implementation Strategy

### Context
Authentication system requires industry-standard security with JWT tokens.

### Options Considered

#### Option A: Extend existing BasicAuth module
- **Pros**: Minimal new code, familiar codebase
- **Cons**: BasicAuth architecture incompatible with OAuth flows
- **Estimated Effort**: 8 hours + significant refactoring

#### Option B: Implement from scratch
- **Pros**: Clean architecture, no legacy constraints
- **Cons**: Duplicate functionality, 200+ LoC
- **Estimated Effort**: 12 hours

#### Option C: Extend BaseAuthProvider with OAuth2 strategy (SELECTED)
- **Pros**: Reuses validation/logging/error handling, clean separation
- **Cons**: Requires learning provider pattern
- **Estimated Effort**: 6 hours
- **Rationale**: Best balance of reuse and clean architecture

### Implementation Notes
- Leverage existing JWT library
- Extend BaseAuthProvider abstract class
- Reuse ValidationService for input sanitization

# FEEDBACK TO INTEGRATE

## Add a standard logging spec

Where: under ### Task Boundaries & Execution Guidance, right after the bullet list that ends with “Logging Instructions…”

Insert:

#### Standard Logging Format (NEW)

All tasks must emit **JSON Lines (one object per line)** to STDOUT/agent log.

**Required fields**: `timestamp` (ISO-8601), `task_id`, `step`, `status` (`start|progress|done|error`), `message` (string), `percent` (0..100, optional), `data` (object, optional).

Example (JSONL):
{"timestamp":"2025-08-23T08:00:01Z","task_id":"P1.T001","step":"generate-migrations","status":"start","message":"begin"}
{"timestamp":"2025-08-23T08:00:12Z","task_id":"P1.T001","step":"generate-migrations","status":"progress","percent":60,"message":"users table created"}
{"timestamp":"2025-08-23T08:00:44Z","task_id":"P1.T001","step":"generate-migrations","status":"done","message":"both migrations written"}

**Agent guidance**: when `status=error`, include `data.error_code` and `data.stack` where available.

## Fix Phase 1 ast-grep section (polyglot + JS stacks)

Where: ## Planning Process → Phase 1: Codebase & Resource Analysis (ENHANCED) under **1. Shared Implementation Resources:**
Replace the entire code block (the one starting with ```javascript and containing the Rails migration pattern) with:

# Use ast-grep (multi-language) to locate shared resources and config hot-spots

# Database migration systems (common stacks)

# Prisma

ast-grep --pattern 'datasource db' --lang=prisma
ast-grep --pattern 'migrate dev' --lang=bash

# Drizzle (SQL/TypeScript)

ast-grep --pattern 'drizzle' --lang=ts
ast-grep --pattern 'CREATE TABLE' --lang=sql --path 'drizzle/**.sql'

# Knex

ast-grep --pattern 'exports.up = (knex)' --lang=js

# Sequelize

ast-grep --pattern 'queryInterface.createTable' --lang=js

# Rails (keep for polyglot repos)

ast-grep --pattern 'class $_ < ActiveRecord::Migration' --lang=ruby

# Deployment configurations

ast-grep --pattern 'deploy:' --lang=yaml
ast-grep --pattern 'name: Deploy' --lang=yaml

# Shared test fixtures

ast-grep --pattern 'fixtures :$_' --lang=ruby
ast-grep --pattern 'beforeAll(' --lang=js
ast-grep --pattern 'setupTestDB' --lang=js

# Configuration modifications / env

ast-grep --pattern 'process.env[$_]' --lang=js
ast-grep --pattern 'ENV[$_]' --lang=ruby

## Un-drift dependency rules (allow infra resource edges)

Where: ## Validation Rules → ### Dependency Validation
Find: - No resource-based dependencies allowed
Replace with:

- No human-resource dependencies. Infrastructure resource-based edges (mutual_exclusion, resource_limited) are allowed with evidence and capacity metadata.

## Tie execution guidance to the logging spec

Where: ## Validation Rules → ### Task Validation
Find: - Execution guidance must include logging instructions
Replace with:

- Execution guidance must include logging instructions following the Standard Logging Format (JSONL with required fields).

⸻

## Adjust edge-density bound to match your example

Where: ## Validation Rules → ### Quality Metrics
Find: - Edge density should be 0.05-0.5 (warn if outside range)
Replace with:

- Edge density should be 0.01-0.5 (warn if outside range)

⸻

## Add an explicit Evidence schema

Where: ## Evidence-Based Dependencies — directly after the bullet - Exclude resource constraints (no "person X needs to be available" edges)
Insert:

### Evidence Object Schema (NEW)

Every task and dependency must include at least one evidence object with:

```json
{
  "type": "plan|code|commit|doc",
  "source": "Plan.md#L120-L138",
  "excerpt": "<short quote with [REDACTED] as needed>",
  "confidence": 0.0,
  "rationale": "Why this evidence supports the edge/task"
}
```

## Make deterministic output verifiable

**Where:** **right after** the closing triple-backticks of the `## System Prompt` block  
**Insert:**

```markdown
## Deterministic Output (Formal)
To make runs reproducible, artifacts must be serialized deterministically before hashing:

1. **Canonical JSON**: lexicographically sort object keys at all depths; arrays remain in computed order; numbers use minimal decimal form; UTF-8; newline termination `\n`.
2. **Line Endings**: normalize to LF only.
3. **Whitespace**: no trailing spaces; indent with two spaces.
4. **Hash Algorithm**: SHA-256 over the canonical bytes; emit lowercase hex.

**Where to record hashes**: include `meta.artifact_hash` in JSON artifacts (`features.json`, `tasks.json`, `dag.json`, `waves.json`).  
In `Plan.md` and `Decisions.md`, include a **Hashes** section listing the SHA-256 of each artifact.

**Example**:
```json
{
  "meta": {
    "artifact_hash": "3b5d5c3712955042212316173ccf37be8e000000000000000000000000000000"
  }
}
```

---

## What this fixes (and why you care)

- **Contradiction nuked:** You were banning resource-based deps while requiring mutual_exclusion/resource_limited. Now it’s consistent and *useful*.
- **JS-first codebase awareness:** ast-grep patterns now cover Prisma/Drizzle/Knex/Sequelize (Rails kept for polyglot).
- **Operational rigor:** A concrete **JSONL logging contract** means agents can stream progress and your evaluator can parse it.
- **Traceability:** A strict **evidence schema** keeps edges honest.
- **Reproducibility:** **Deterministic hashing** lets you diff plan artifacts with confidence.
- **Metrics sanity:** Edge-density bound matches your Wave/DAG example instead of flagging it red for no reason.

# Feedback to Consider

Here are some techniques and ideas to mitigate the concerns raised about the T.A.S.K.S. system:

## 1. Quantifying Confidence Objectively

The subjective "confidence score" can be made more objective by tying it to data and established methodologies.

RICE Scoring Model Adaptation: The RICE model (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort) is a popular product management framework for prioritizing features, and its confidence component is often quantified using discrete percentages (e.g., 50% for low confidence, 80% for medium, 100% for high) rather than an arbitrary number. T.A.S.K.S. could adapt this by defining confidence based on specific project metrics, such as:

Code Coverage: Higher code coverage on the sections of the codebase being modified or added could directly increase the confidence score for a task.

Test Results and Stability: The stability of the test suite and the number of test cases (especially for critical features) can be used as a metric. A high pass rate and a robust set of tests could directly contribute to a higher confidence score in the task's outcome.

Historical Data: Leveraging historical project data from previous T.A.S.K.S. executions could provide a baseline. For example, if similar tasks in the past consistently completed within the estimated complexity, the new task could be assigned a higher confidence.

Probabilistic Forecasting: Instead of a single confidence score, T.A.S.K.S. could adopt a probabilistic approach. Using a Monte Carlo simulation, the system could generate a range of possible completion dates for a project, each with a corresponding confidence level. This would replace a single, potentially misleading, confidence score with a more transparent and statistically-backed range of possibilities. This could be integrated with the system's ability to model dependencies to produce a more realistic project forecast.

Metric-Driven Automation: Automating the collection of metrics from existing tools would reduce the manual effort for estimating confidence. For instance, a CI/CD pipeline could automatically run code analysis and tests, feeding data like code coverage and test pass rates back to T.A.S.K.S., which would then use this data to automatically calculate a confidence score.

## 2. Tooling Integration Opportunities

To minimize manual overhead and improve the system's capabilities, T.A.S.K.S. should be designed for seamless integration with a variety of existing development tools.

Version Control & CI/CD Integration: The system's CLI (Command Line Interface) is well-suited for integration with CI/CD pipelines like Jenkins or GitHub Actions. This would allow for automated planning (tasks plan) and execution (tasks execute --dry-run) on code changes, enabling a "shift-left" approach to project planning and validation. By integrating with Git, T.A.S.K.S. can automatically access and analyze the codebase without manual file transfers.

Project Management & Collaboration Tools: Integrating with popular tools like Jira, Trello, or Wrike would allow T.A.S.K.S. to create, update, and track tasks directly in the team's existing workflow. The system's generated JSON artifacts (tasks.json) could be mapped to an issue tracking system's API, automating the creation of tickets for each task and its dependencies.

Monitoring & Resource Management: To better support its Rolling Frontier Execution model, T.A.S.K.S. could integrate with monitoring platforms like Prometheus or Grafana. This would provide real-time metrics on worker CPU/memory usage, allowing the coordinator to make more informed decisions about task assignment and resource allocation, thereby reducing the risk of a single worker becoming a bottleneck.

Communication Platforms: Automating notifications and status updates via tools like Slack or Microsoft Teams would keep the team informed of project progress, potential roadblocks, or failed tasks without requiring constant manual checks.

The video "4 Ways to Automate Project Management" from SmartSuite discusses four strategies to automate project management tasks to save time and increase efficiency. The key takeaways from the video and related resources are:

- **Automate email communication:** Use a work management software to email clients directly from the tool and have their responses automatically show up within it.
- **Create a forwarding system:** Automate retroactive task creation by using a forwarding system.
- **Automate task reminders:** Set up automated reminders for overdue or upcoming tasks to ensure deadlines are met without manual follow-up.
- **Automate process enforcement:** Implement automations that enforce project processes, such as automatically changing a task's status back to "In Progress" if a step like client approval is missed.
- **Automate daily stand-up reporting (bonus tip):** Use a "Scrum View" in your work management tool to see completed tasks at a glance, eliminating the need for manual reports.

The video also suggests using tools like SmartSuite and Zapier to implement these automations. The overall goal is to free up team members to focus on more strategic, human-centric tasks by offloading repetitive, administrative work to automation.
