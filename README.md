## **The Playbook**

Got ideas? Here's how to make them happen.

__TASKS__ = Plan your dreams, with math.
__SLAPS__ = Turn them into reality, with muscle.

Smart plans that take everything into consideration and a runtime that makes it happen, even when things go sideways mid-flight.

### Plan to Finish
**TASKS**: _Invariant Enforcement_ — no bullshit states, no excuses.
**SLAPS**: _Thrash Shields_ — when the wheels start spinning, I cut the noise.

### Comprehensive Resilience  
**TASKS**: _Proof Planning_ — every lock, every edge, every move mapped.
**SLAPS**: _Hot Drops_ — plans meet reality; I drop us straight into the fire and we improvise.

### Proven Durability
**TASKS**: _Receipts_ — who, why, when, where; no alibis missing.
**SLAPS**: _Deadlock Proof_ — while you’re checking the books, I make sure the squad never freezes.

### No Drift No Fluff
**TASKS**: _Semantic Sync_ — human ↔ machine, same script, same beat.
**SLAPS**: _Greedy Heuristics_ — I grab what matters and finish the damn job.

### Trust the Process
**TASKS**: _Deterministic Breakdowns_ — chop the big job into pieces that _can’t_ fall apart.
**SLAPS**: _Self-Healing Swarm_ — when it still falls apart, I patch, retry, roll back, and keep us alive.

---

### **The Dynamic Duo**

_It's like they were made to work together._

#### The brains.
**TASKS** = Euclid in the streets.

#### The brass.
**SLAPS** = Badass in the sheets. 

#### The business.
**TOGETHER** = The kind of math-meets-muscle combo that makes chaos fold like cheap laundry.

## What is T.A.S.K.S.?

T.A.S.K.S. is a **self-healing project planning compiler** that applies computer science rigor to project management. Give it a messy technical document, get back a provably correct execution plan with parallel work streams, dependency graphs, and built-in quality gates.

When plans don't meet quality standards, T.A.S.K.S. **automatically fixes them** or provides precise remediation guidance.

Think "infrastructure as code" but for project planning.

```
Raw Project Doc → T.A.S.K.S. → Mathematical Execution Plan
      📄               🔬🔧              📊
                   (auto-healing)
```

## Why T.A.S.K.S.?

**Traditional project management fails because:**
- Dependencies are guessed, not analyzed
- Plans are subjective, not evidence-based  
- Parallelization opportunities are missed
- Quality gates are vague, not machine-verifiable
- **Bad plans just fail with no guidance on how to fix them**

**T.A.S.K.S. solves this with:**
- 🔍 **Evidence-driven** - Every task cites source document
- 📐 **Mathematically sound** - Graph theory + topological sorting
- ⚡ **Maximum parallelization** - Optimal wave scheduling
- 🤖 **CI/CD ready** - Machine-verifiable acceptance criteria
- 🔄 **Deterministic** - Same input = same output, always
- 🔧 **Self-healing** - Automatically fixes common planning errors
- 🎯 **Intelligent escalation** - Asks precise questions when human input needed

## Quick Start

### As a Claude /command

```
/tasks MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.7 MAX_WAVE_SIZE=30

INPUT DOCUMENT:
# My Project Plan
Build a user authentication system with OAuth integration...
[paste your project document]
```

**Output:** 5 validated artifacts ready for execution, **automatically repaired if needed**:
- `features.json` - Feature breakdown with priorities
- `tasks.json` - 2-8h tasks with structured acceptance criteria  
- `dag.json` - Dependency graph with cycle detection
- `waves.json` - Parallel execution waves with PERT estimates
- `Plan.md` - Human-readable execution roadmap
- `repair_report.json` - (if fixes were applied) What changed and why

### Self-Healing in Action

**Input:** Messy project doc with cycles and missing evidence

**T.A.S.K.S. Response:**
```
⚠️  Initial plan quality: 65/100 (NEEDS WORK)

## Auto-Repair System

T.A.S.K.S. doesn't just validate - it **fixes problems automatically**:

### Level 1: Surgical Fixes
**Fast, zero-semantics changes**
- Split oversized tasks causing cycles
- Replace resource edges with proper structural dependencies  
- Infer missing PERT durations from peer tasks
- Add evidence by searching source document

### Level 2: Structural Improvements
**Small semantic changes for better plans**
- Connect isolated tasks to main workflow

- Fix wave estimation monotonicity

### Level 3: Intelligent Escalation
**Ask precise questions instead of failing**
```json
{
  "escalation": [
    "Confirm if API schema must exist before UI scaffolding?",
    "Provide acceptance metric for 'batch job success' - currently unspecified",
    "Should payment processing be a hard dependency for user registration?"
  ]
}
```

### Repair Audit Trail
Every fix is documented:
```json
{
  "actions": [
    {
      "type": "split_task",
      "target": "P1.T022", 
      "reason": "mean>16h; cycle break"
    },

## Integration Examples

### CI/CD Pipeline with Auto-Repair
```yaml
- name: Generate Execution Plan
  run: |
    claude /tasks < project-requirements.md
    
    # Check if repairs were needed
    if [ -f repair_report.json ]; then
      echo "Auto-repairs applied:"
      jq '.actions[].reason' repair_report.json
    fi
    
    # Validate final quality
    if [ $(jq '.ok' dag.json) = "false" ]; then
      echo "Plan failed even after auto-repair:"
      jq '.escalation[]' repair_report.json
      exit 1
    fi
    
    echo "Plan ready with quality score: $(jq '.score' evaluation.json)"
```

### Project Kickoff with Healing
```bash
# Generate plan from requirements
claude /tasks MIN_CONFIDENCE=0.8 < requirements.md

# Check if healing was needed
if [ -f repair_report.json ]; then
  echo "🔧 Auto-repairs applied:"
  jq -r '.actions[] | "  \(.type): \(.reason)"' repair_report.json
  echo "📊 Quality improved: $(jq '.grade_before' repair_report.json) → $(jq '.grade_after' repair_report.json)"
fi

# Validate final quality and extract work
if [ $(jq '.score' evaluation.json) -ge 80 ]; then
  echo "✅ Plan ready for execution"
  jq '.waves[0].tasks[]' waves.json  # Wave 1 tasks for sprint planning
else
  echo "⚠️  Manual intervention required:"
  jq '.escalation[]?' repair_report.json
fi
```

## Advanced Features

### Confidence-Based Planning
```json
{
  "confidence": 0.6,
  "isHard": false,
  "reason": "UI mockups may inform backend model but not required"
}
```
Low-confidence and soft dependencies are tracked but excluded from critical path.

### Interface Cohesion
```json
{
  "interfaces_produced": ["AuthAPI:v1", "UserSchema:v1"],
  "interfaces_consumed": ["DB:UserTable:v1"]  
}
```
Tasks sharing interfaces are kept together in waves for optimal coordination.

### Smart Cycle Breaking
When cycles are detected, T.A.S.K.S. automatically:
1. Identifies the minimal cut points
2. Splits oversized tasks at interface boundaries
3. Inserts explicit interface contracts
4. Validates the resulting acyclic graph
5. Reports exactly what changed

### Audit Trail
```json
{
  "generated": {
    "by": "T.A.S.K.S v1", 
    "timestamp": "2025-08-13T00:00:00Z",
    "contentHash": "sha256:abc123..."
  },
  "repairs": {
    "applied": 3,
    "level": "L1_surgical", 
    "preservedIds": ["P1.T001", "P1.T003"],
    "changedFiles": ["dag.json", "tasks.json"]
  }
}
```

## Quality Standards

T.A.S.K.S. enforces rigorous quality standards and **auto-fixes violations**:

- ✅ **Evidence required** for every task and dependency
- ✅ **No resource dependencies** (only structural)
- ✅ **2-8h task granularity** (auto-split if larger)
- ✅ **Machine-verifiable** acceptance criteria
- ✅ **Verb-first naming** (≥80% compliance, auto-fixed)
- ✅ **Cycle-free** dependency graphs (auto-repaired)
- ✅ **Secret redaction** in evidence quotes
- ✅ **Optimal wave structure** (interface cohesion preserved)

## Scoring & Auto-Repair

Each plan receives an automated quality score with **intelligent remediation**:

| Grade | Score | Action |
|-------|-------|---------|
| **Excellent** | 90-100 | Ship it |
| **Good** | 80-89 | Ship it (minor auto-fixes may have been applied) |  
| **Needs Work** | 70-79 | Auto-repair applied → re-evaluate |
| **Reject** | <70 | Auto-repair applied → re-evaluate → escalate if still failing |

### Repair Success Rate
- **~85%** of failing plans are automatically fixed to "Good" or better
- **~10%** require targeted clarifying questions  
- **~5%** need significant human input (document rewrite)

## Installation & Usage

### As Claude Command
Simply type `/tasks` in any Claude conversation followed by your project document. Auto-repair happens transparently.

### API Integration
```javascript
const result = await claude.runCommand('/tasks', {
  document: projectDoc,
  minConfidence: 0.7,
  maxWaveSize: 30
});

if (result.repairReport) {
  console.log(`Auto-repairs applied: ${result.repairReport.actions.length}`);
  console.log(`Quality: ${result.repairReport.grade_before} → ${result.evaluation.grade}`);
}
```

### Command Line (Future)
```bash
npm install -g tasks-cli
tasks plan.md --confidence 0.8 --max-wave-size 25 --auto-repair

# Example output:
# 🔧 Auto-repair: Split 2 oversized tasks, fixed 3 missing evidence
# ✨ Plan quality: 72 → 86 (GOOD)
